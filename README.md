## What is this Script?

levelup is a script that levels you up using your available resources, and some purchased from the mall. It focuses on inexpensive things that are available to low-shiny players, so it may purchase things you don't need if you are very shiny. It is based on the post-prism leveling strategy used by goorbo.

## Installation

Run the following in kolmafia's GCLI:

```text
git checkout https://github.com/frazazel/levelup.git release
```

## How to Use

Run `levelup`, with optional additional arguments (e.g.`levelup targetlevel=15`). To see a list of all available run-time settings, run `levelup help`. To see a list of required / recommended items, skills, and familiars, run `levelup sim`. levelup is also configurable via relay script, in the topbar pulldown menu in the relay browser.

## Who is Levelup For?

It is aimed first and foremost at new players with few shinies, and it aims to complete leveling to level 13 without requiring any specific expensive or unobtainable item besides the Grey Goose, within 30 adventures, spending approximately 150k on potions, mojo filters and and spleen items with +exp% and +mainstat effects. It does support some IotMs and other expensive and/or hard-to-acquire items, and is expected to support more over time, but support for low-shiny players is the primary goal of levelup. Shinier players may wish to fork levelup and modify it for their own use.
